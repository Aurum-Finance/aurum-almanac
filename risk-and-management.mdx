## Collateral Protection

We built conservative. Here's how we protect your position:

**200% minimum ratio.** You need twice the collateral value of what you borrow. SOL drops 40%? You're still safe.

**No liquidations. Period.** We don't have liquidation code. Can't liquidate what doesn't exist.

**Positions improve over time.** Every bit of yield makes your position safer. Time is on your side.

**50% max borrow.** You can only borrow half your collateral's value. Plenty of breathing room.

## Getting Prices Right

Bad price data kills protocols. We use two oracles:

Switchboard gives us primary prices. Pyth double-checks and serves as backup. If prices look weird, we catch it. Time-weighted averaging smooths out spikes. No flash crash can touch your position.

## Managing Protocol Risk

We're not trying to eat the world on day one:

**Deposit caps** keep growth controlled. We'll raise them as we prove the system.

**Per-user limits** prevent whales from dominating the protocol.

**Diversified yield sources** spread risk across multiple protocols.

**Controlled growth** means we expand carefully, not recklessly.

## Yield Source Security

We only integrate with proven protocols:

Each yield source we use has been audited and battle-tested in production. We monitor performance across all integrated vaults constantly. If a yield source underperforms or shows risk, we can reallocate. Multiple integrations mean no single point of failure.

We're not experimenting with your money.

## When Things Go Wrong

Hope for the best, plan for the worst:

**Emergency pause button** if we detect issues. Better to pause than lose funds.

**Clean withdrawal process** if we need to wind down. Everyone gets their money back.

**On-call team** ready to respond to emergencies.

We can't predict everything, but we can prepare for anything.
