## Collateralization Safeguards

Aurum's primary defense against market volatility lies in its conservative collateralization requirements:

- **200% Minimum Ratio**: All positions must maintain at least 200% collateralization (2:1 ratio of collateral to debt)
- **No Liquidation Mechanism**: Unlike traditional lending protocols, Aurum does not implement liquidations
- **Self-Healing Positions**: As yield continuously reduces debt, positions naturally become more secure over time
- **Conservative LTV**: The 50% maximum loan-to-value ratio provides substantial buffer against market fluctuations

## Oracle Implementation

Reliable price data is critical to protocol security. Aurum implements:

- **Dual Oracle System**:
   - Primary: Switchboard provides main price feeds
   - Secondary: Pyth serves as verification and fallback
   - Cross-validation logic ensures price accuracy
- **Price Update Frequency**: Regular price updates ensure the protocol operates with current market data
- **Manipulation Protection**: Outlier detection and time-weighted averaging prevent flash crashes or manipulation from affecting protocol operations

## Exposure Limits

To manage protocol-wide risk, Aurum implements several capacity controls:

- **Total Deposit Cap**: Maximum SOL that can be deposited into the protocol
- **Per-User Limits**: Caps on individual position sizes to prevent concentration risk
- **Utilization Targets**: Managed allocation of deposits to different yield strategies
- **TVL Growth Rate**: Controlled expansion of protocol capacity to ensure stability

## Drift Vault Risk Management

By integrating with Drift's vault system, Aurum inherits several proven risk management features:

- **Strategy Diversification**: Exposure across multiple yield sources within Drift's ecosystem
- **Smart Contract Security**: Leveraging Drift's extensively audited and battle-tested infrastructure
- **Liquidity Management**: Careful balance between yield generation and withdrawal capabilities
- **Monitoring Systems**: Continuous oversight of vault performance and risk metrics

## Contingency Planning

Aurum prepares for adverse scenarios through a comprehensive contingency framework:

- **Emergency Shutdown**: Protocol pause capability if critical issues are detected
- **Graceful Withdrawal Process**: Structured wind-down procedure to return user funds if necessary
- **Reserve Fund**: Planned allocation of protocol revenue to an insurance fund for addressing unforeseen events
- **Response Team**: Dedicated technical team available to address emergencies

This multi-layered approach to risk management ensures that Aurum can withstand market turbulence while protecting user assets and maintaining protocol stability.
