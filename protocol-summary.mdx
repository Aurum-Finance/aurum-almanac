*Hearken, noble investors and seekers of prosperity! The Aurum Protocol presents a golden opportunity in the realm of decentralized finance.*

## Core Concept

Aurum introduces self-repaying loans through automated yield generation on Solana. This innovative mechanism allows borrowers to leverage their assets while watching their debt diminish over timeâ€”without additional capital injection.

At its essence, Aurum enables users to:

- Deposit SOL as collateral
- Borrow aurSOL (up to 50% of collateral value)
- Watch as generated yield automatically pays down their loan balance

## Key Mechanism

The sovereign engine of Aurum operates through a carefully orchestrated process:

1. **Collateral Deposits**: Users deposit SOL into Aurum's secure vaults
2. **Yield Generation**: Deposited SOL is allocated to Drift's yield-generating vaults
3. **Automated Repayment**: 80% of yield is systematically applied to reduce the user's outstanding debt
4. **Protocol Sustainability**: The remaining 20% of yield supports protocol operations and development

This creates a virtuous cycle where borrowers benefit from capital access while their debt burden lightens over time.

## Unique Value Proposition

Aurum stands apart from traditional lending protocols through several distinct advantages:

- **No Liquidation Risk**: The 200% collateralization minimum and self-repaying nature eliminate the threat of liquidation
- **True Passive Income**: Borrowers enjoy declining debt without active management
- **Capital Efficiency**: Access to 50% of deposited value while maintaining full exposure to SOL's potential appreciation
- **Simplified DeFi Experience**: Complex yield strategies managed automatically beneath a simple interface

As the Solana ecosystem continues to flourish, Aurum provides a secure harbor where users can navigate the seas of DeFi with confidence and strategic advantage.
