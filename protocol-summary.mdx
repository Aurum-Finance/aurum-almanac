## What is Aurum?
Aurum gives you self-repaying loans. You deposit SOL, borrow aurSOL, and watch your debt shrink automatically. No extra payments needed.

Here's the simple version:

- Deposit SOL as collateral
- Borrow up to 50% of that value in aurSOL
- The yield from your SOL pays down your loan

## How It Actually Works

Think of it like this: You put 100 SOL in a vault. That SOL goes to work in Drift's yield strategies. You can borrow 50 SOL worth of aurSOL right away. The yield your deposit generates? 80% goes straight to paying down your loan. The other 20% keeps the protocol running.

Your debt gets smaller every day without you lifting a finger.

## Why Aurum Beats Traditional Lending

Let me count the ways:
- You can't get liquidated. With 200% collateralization and automatic debt reduction, liquidation isn't even in the code.
- Your loan shrinks on its own. Remember that friend who borrowed $20 and never paid you back? This is the opposite of that.
- You get cash now while keeping your SOL. Need liquidity but think SOL is going up? Perfect. Borrow against it without selling.
- It just works. No managing positions, no watching health factors, no 3am liquidation nightmares.
- Traditional lending makes you the hamster on the wheel. With Aurum, the wheel spins itself.
