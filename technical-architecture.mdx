## The Vault System

Aurum runs on three main parts that work together like a Swiss watch:

- The Vault Controller is the brain. It handles your deposits, tracks your position, and makes sure aurSOL gets minted when you borrow. Think of it as the bouncer, the accountant, and the manager all rolled into one smart contract.
- Position Management keeps tabs on everyone. Your collateral, your debt, your accumulated yield, it's all tracked here. Every Satoshi accounted for.
- The Yield Capture System is where the magic happens. It talks to yield generating vaults, grabs your yield, and splits it: 80% to pay your debt, 20% to keep the lights on.

## Safety First (Actually)

We built this thing to survive anything:
- 200% collateralization minimum. You need 200 USD of SOL to borrow 100. That's a huge cushion against price swings.
- Two oracle sources. We use both Switchboard and Pyth. If one goes wonky, the other catches it. No flash crash disasters here.
- Automatic circuit breakers. If things get weird, the protocol pauses. Better safe than sorry.
- No surprise changes. Protocol parameters only change through governance. No rug pulls, no "oops we changed the rules."
- Every line of code assumes something will go wrong. We built for the worst case, so you get the best case.
