## Vault System

Aurum's infrastructure is built around a robust vault system that securely manages deposited assets while enabling the minting and management of aurSOL.

### Key Components:

- **Vault Controller**: The primary program that governs all user interactions with the protocol, managing deposits, withdrawals, and the minting/burning of aurSOL. The controller maintains the state of all positions and enforces protocol parameters.
- **Position Management**: Each user's deposit and borrowing activity is tracked through a dedicated position account, maintaining precise records of collateral amounts, outstanding debt, and accumulated yield.
- **Yield Capture System**: A specialized component that interfaces with Drift vaults to harvest generated yield and allocate it appropriately between debt reduction and protocol revenue.

## Safety Controls

To ensure protocol stability and protect user assets, Aurum implements several critical safety mechanisms:

- **200% Minimum Collateralization**: All positions must maintain at least 200% collateralization, providing a substantial buffer against market volatility.
- **Dual Oracle System**: Price data is sourced from both Switchboard and Pyth, with validation logic to prevent oracle manipulation or failures from affecting protocol operations.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic activity suspension triggers that activate during extreme market conditions or detected anomalies.
- **Parameter Governance**: Key protocol parameters are managed through a controlled governance process to prevent sudden changes that could destabilize the system.

## Drift Integration

Aurum leverages Drift's battle-tested vault infrastructure for yield generation:

- **Direct Vault Connection**: SOL deposits are allocated to Drift's yield-generating vaults through secure program interfaces.
- **Yield Strategy**: Deposits benefit from Drift's sophisticated yield strategies while maintaining the security guarantees of the Aurum protocol.
- **Data Flow**: Regular communication between Aurum and Drift ensures accurate yield information and proper accounting of all generated returns.
- **Withdrawal Pipeline**: A structured process for transitioning assets from Drift vaults back to Aurum when users request withdrawals, balancing security with timely access.

All components are designed with security-first principles, extensive error handling, and defense-in-depth strategies to protect user assets against both technical failures and malicious attacks.
