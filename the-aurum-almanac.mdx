## A Chronicle of Self-Repaying Finance

*Hark! Noble seekers of prosperity and innovation, welcome to the golden realm of Aurum.*

You know how traditional loans work? You borrow money, you stress about repayments, you worry about liquidation. We threw that playbook out the window.

With Aurum, your loan pays itself back. Seriously.

Here's what we built: You deposit SOL, borrow against it, and the yield from your deposit chips away at your debt. No liquidation. No stress. Just math working in your favor.

This guide walks you through everything: how it works, what makes it safe, and where we're headed. Whether you're a trader looking for liquidity or a developer building on top of us, you'll find what you need here.

The Aurum Protocol changes how lending works on Solana. We connect your deposited SOL to Drift's yield vaults, and that yield automatically reduces your debt over time. You can't get liquidated. Ever.

We're documenting everything as we build. From the technical guts to the economics, this almanac shows you exactly how Aurum works and why it matters.
