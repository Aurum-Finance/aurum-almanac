## A Chronicle of Self-Repaying Finance

---

*Hark! Noble seekers of prosperity and innovation, welcome to the golden realm of Aurum.*

*As alchemists of old sought to transmute base metals into gold, so too does the Aurum Protocol transform the very nature of lending and borrowing in the digital age. Here within these pages lies the wisdom of a new financial paradigm—one where loans diminish of their own accord and the sword of liquidation no longer hangs above the borrower's head.*

*This Almanac serves as both map and compass for navigating the sovereign territory of self-repaying finance. Whether you be a humble trader seeking liquidity or a learned developer crafting integrations, may these chronicles illuminate your path.*

*Proceed now through these hallowed sections, where the architecture of Aurum is laid bare with clarity and precision. Witness how yield becomes liberation from debt, how risk is managed with prudence, and how our realm shall grow in the seasons to come.*

*The golden age of finance awaits those bold enough to grasp it.*

The Aurum Protocol reimagines lending on Solana through a revolutionary self-repaying mechanism. By channeling yield from deposited SOL through Drift's battle-tested vaults, borrowers watch their debt diminish automatically over time—without liquidation risk.

This document provides essential information for understanding Aurum's design, mechanics, and roadmap as we prepare for deployment. From technical architecture to user economics, the Aurum Almanac offers a comprehensive overview of our protocol's foundation and vision.

As we pursue grants and strategic partnerships, particularly with Drift, this documentation demonstrates the careful planning and innovation behind Aurum's approach to decentralized finance.

Welcome to the future of self-repaying loans.
