## How Much Can You Borrow?

**Simple math:** deposit SOL, borrow up to half its value.

Let's use real numbers. You deposit 100 SOL. You can borrow 50 SOL worth of aurSOL. Your collateralization starts at 200%.
As yield rolls in, your debt drops but your collateral stays the same. Your position gets safer over time, not riskier.

## What Does It Cost?

We keep it simple:
1% upfront fee when you borrow. Borrow 50 SOL worth? Pay 0.5 SOL. One time, done.
80/20 yield split. Your deposit makes 10 SOL this year? 8 SOL pays down your debt, 2 SOL goes to protocol operations.
Nothing else. No deposit fees. No withdrawal fees. No "maintenance" fees. Just Solana network costs when you transact.

### Show Me the Numbers
You deposit 100 SOL. Let's say vaults typically yield 8% annually. Here's your year:

- Your SOL generates ~8 SOL in yield
- ~6.4 SOL reduces your debt (80%)
- ~1.6 SOL goes to the protocol (20%)
- You paid 0.5 SOL upfront to borrow

Your 50 SOL debt becomes 43.6 SOL. Without doing anything.

## Getting Out

**You've got options:**
- Do nothing. Let yield eat away at your debt. Eventually it hits zero.
- Withdraw some. As long as you stay above 200% collateralization, take what you need.
- Pay it off. Buy back your aurSOL debt, get all your collateral back.
- Wait it out. Once yield pays everything off, your full collateral is yours again.
- No penalties. No lockups. Your money, your timeline.
