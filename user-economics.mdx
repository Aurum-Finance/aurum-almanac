## Deposit & Borrow Mechanics

Aurum's economic model is designed for simplicity and user benefit, with transparent parameters:

- **Collateralization Ratio**: Users may borrow up to 50% of their deposited collateral value, maintaining a minimum 200% collateralization ratio.
- **Example Position**:
   - Deposit: 100 SOL (~$12,000 at current prices)
   - Maximum Borrow: 50 SOL worth of aurSOL (~$6,000)
   - Initial Collateralization: 200%
- **Position Evolution**: As yield accrues, the debt balance decreases while collateral remains unchanged, gradually increasing the collateralization ratio and improving position security.

## Fee Structure

Aurum maintains a straightforward fee structure designed to balance user value with protocol sustainability:

- **Initial Borrow Fee**: 1% of borrowed amount (e.g., 0.5 SOL on a 50 SOL borrow)
- **Yield Allocation**: 80% of generated yield applies to debt reduction, 20% to protocol operations
- **No Hidden Costs**: No deposit fees, withdrawal fees, or maintenance fees
- **Standard Transaction Fees**: Only standard Solana network fees apply for interactions with the protocol

## User Benefits Analysis

For a typical user with a 100 SOL deposit generating 8% annual yield:

- **Annual Yield Generation**: ~8 SOL
- **Debt Reduction**: ~6.4 SOL (80% of yield)
- **Protocol Revenue**: ~1.6 SOL (20% of yield)
- **Initial Borrow Fee**: 0.5 SOL (one-time)

### Key Benefits:

1. **Passive Debt Reduction**: Loans that pay themselves down without additional capital
2. **No Liquidation Risk**: Positions cannot be liquidated due to market volatility
3. **Capital Efficiency**: Access to 50% of deposited value while maintaining full SOL exposure
4. **Flexible Duration**: No fixed terms or repayment schedules
5. **Simplified Experience**: No need to actively manage complex yield strategies

## Exit Options

Users enjoy flexible exit options to suit different circumstances:

- **Maintain Position**: Allow yield to continuously reduce debt over time
- **Partial Withdrawal**: Withdraw a portion of collateral (subject to maintaining minimum collateralization)
- **Full Repayment**: Repay remaining aurSOL debt and withdraw all collateral
- **Natural Completion**: Once debt is fully paid off by yield, withdraw full collateral

This economic structure creates alignment between user and protocol interests, with both benefiting from successful yield generation and long-term engagement.
