## How We're Different

Let's compare Aurum to what's out there:

### vs. Traditional Lending (Solend, Kamino, etc.)

They make you watch health factors like a hawk. One bad day and you're liquidated.

We don't do liquidations. Your loan pays itself back. You sleep better.

They need constant management. Check rates, manage positions, repay manually.

We're set-and-forget. Deposit once, debt shrinks automatically.

### vs. Yield Platforms

Yield aggregators lock up your capital. Want to access it? Withdraw everything.

We give you 50% liquidity immediately while your collateral still earns. Best of both worlds.

## Technical Edge

We picked Solana for a reason:

**Cheap and fast.** Penny transactions mean we can harvest yield and update positions constantly without eating into returns.

**Best-in-class integrations.** We connect to proven yield sources like Marginfi, Kamino, and others. Why build from scratch when giants already exist?

**Clean architecture.** Separate modules for deposits, yields, and debt. Easier to audit, harder to break.

## Built for Humans

Here's what users actually care about:

**Real passive income.** Not "check back daily" passive. Actually passive.

**Flexibility.** Need to hedge? Use your aurSOL. Market pumping? Your SOL is still yours.

**Peace of mind.** No liquidation = no 3am anxiety.

**No deadlines.** Keep your position as long as you want. Close it when you want.

## Why Multi-Protocol Strategy Works

We're not tied to one yield source. That's our superpower:

**Diversification built in.** Your SOL works across multiple protocols. One has issues? The others keep earning.

**Optimization opportunities.** We can shift allocations to wherever yield is best.

**Partnership friendly.** We make every integrated protocol better by bringing them users.

**Future proof.** New yield source launches? We can integrate it.
